6. Gain remote access to the target.  Explain how you gained access to the target.
Used ssh and then just inputed an empty password when asked for my login credentials

7. Here is a new target IP address: 162.209.120.91.  *****Without using Nmap or directly accessing the target via IP address*****, determine the open ports of this target and what this target is.

8. NETGEAR R8000, R7000, and R6400 routers have known vulnerabilities.  Using SHODAN, determine how many of them are (still) exposed on the Internet. An article from last December: https://arstechnica.com/security/2016/12/unpatched-bug-allows-hackers-to-seize-control-of-netgear-routers/
